Simulation instructions:

If you don't wanna deal with the mess, all you care about are the files (ordered by dependence):

Transform.py

Simulate.py

produce.py

runMany.sh

N is the number of events per run, M is the average poissonian multiplicity. You can edit produce.py for pt distribution if you want.
